Just a small machine learning exercise for uni (in Bulgarian).

Exercise is [this](https://github.com/nikoladevelops/machine-learning-exercise/blob/main/%D0%92%D0%9C%D0%A3-%D0%97%D0%B0%D0%B4%D0%B0%D1%87%D0%B01.ipynb), with an additional requirement of improving the code / changing parameters / boosting performance if possible / documenting how.
